# Java Metronome
 A simple Java implementation of a metronome following the MVC architecture.
 
 The code is seperated into 5 different packages:
   - metier (model)
   - ihm (view)
   - controle (control)
   - lanceur (launcher)
   - tests (JUnit tests)
  
The documentation and code has been written in French but a future fork will translate all the code in English.

The view part is extremely simple and is using basic Java elements as well as a default sound. Because of the MVC architecture it is really simple to plug in any other interface.
